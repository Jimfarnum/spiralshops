## About SPIRAL  

At SPIRAL, everything begins with a simple belief: **it's not about us, it's about you.**  

SPIRAL exists to make shopping feel local again—whether you're a shopper searching for the right item, a retailer connecting with new customers, or a mall creating experiences that bring communities together.  

Behind the scenes, SPIRAL quietly runs on a unique layer of intelligence we call our **Admin LLM.** This isn't just another AI—it's a private assistant designed to serve **shoppers, retailers, and malls** by turning raw activity into meaningful actions.  

- **For shoppers:** SPIRAL notices what matters to you—what you search, when you browse, and how you prefer to shop. With your consent, it highlights the right stores, products, and offers nearby—helping you spend less time hunting and more time finding.  

- **For retailers:** SPIRAL transforms data into clear, useful guidance. From uncovering missed search opportunities to spotting abandoned cart patterns, the Admin LLM delivers insights that help you sell more, serve better, and adapt faster.  

- **For malls:** SPIRAL surfaces traffic patterns, trending categories, and event opportunities. It gives mall managers the tools to support tenants, boost categories that need help, and create experiences that bring shoppers in.  

The Admin LLM works invisibly in the background: tracking site traffic, monitoring searches, analyzing carts and checkouts, and routing information to the right audience—whether that's a weekly insight for a retailer, an event suggestion for a mall, or a personalized reminder for a shopper.  

**SPIRAL: The Local Shopping Platform—built for people, powered by data, designed to serve.**

# ðŸ”’ SPIRAL SSL Certificate Issue - Immediate Fix Required

## Problem Identified
**Domain:** spiralshops.com
**Error:** NET::ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID
**Issue:** SSL certificate doesn't match the domain name

## Root Cause Analysis

### **Certificate Mismatch:**
- SSL certificate issued for different domain than spiralshops.com
- Common Name (CN) in certificate doesn't match the requested domain
- Browser security blocking access to protect user data

### **Possible Causes:**
1. **Certificate issued for wrong domain** (e.g., spiralmalls.com instead of spiralshops.com)
2. **Self-signed certificate** not recognized by browsers
3. **Expired certificate** needs renewal
4. **Wildcard certificate** missing subdomain coverage
5. **DNS pointing to wrong server** with different certificate

## Immediate Solutions

### **Option 1: Domain Redirect Fix**
If spiralshops.com should redirect to spiralmalls.com:
```
1. Update DNS CNAME record: spiralshops.com â†’ spiralmalls.com
2. Configure 301 permanent redirect
3. Use spiralmalls.com certificate for both domains
```

### **Option 2: New Certificate for spiralshops.com**
If spiralshops.com is the primary domain:
```
1. Generate new SSL certificate for spiralshops.com
2. Include both www.spiralshops.com and spiralshops.com
3. Update server configuration
4. Deploy certificate to hosting provider
```

### **Option 3: Multi-Domain Certificate**
For both domains:
```
1. Request SAN (Subject Alternative Names) certificate
2. Include both spiralshops.com and spiralmalls.com
3. Configure server to use same certificate for both
```

## Technical Implementation

### **Replit Deployment Fix:**
```javascript
// server/config/ssl.js
const sslConfig = {
  domains: ['spiralshops.com', 'www.spiralshops.com'],
  certificate: process.env.SSL_CERT,
  privateKey: process.env.SSL_KEY,
  chain: process.env.SSL_CHAIN
};
```

### **GoDaddy DNS Configuration:**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: spiralshops.com
Value: your-replit-domain.repl.dev
TTL: 600 seconds
```

### **Domain Forwarding Setup:**
```
Source Domain: spiralshops.com
Destination: https://spiralmalls.com
Forward Type: 301 Permanent
Masking: Disabled
```

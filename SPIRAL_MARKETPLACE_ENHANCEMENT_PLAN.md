- **Community Building** - Social commerce with local roots
- **Shared Resources Model** - Cost advantages for small retailers

### **Strategic Implementation Approach:**
1. Build features that major platforms CAN'T replicate easily
2. Focus on local/community aspects they ignore

5. Maintain human touch that big platforms lack

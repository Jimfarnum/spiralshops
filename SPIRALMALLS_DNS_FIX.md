# ðŸš¨ URGENT: spiralmalls.com DNS Records Restoration

## Problem: DNS Records Accidentally Deleted

spiralmalls.com DNS records were deleted by mistake. This needs immediate restoration to prevent site downtime.

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### **Restore spiralmalls.com DNS with these records:**

**Option 1 - Point to Replit (Safest for now):**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: @
Value: 27d4f357-044c-4271-84d2-b2bf67be7115-00-18jv7lspv4am.janeway.replit.dev
TTL: 1 Hour

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: 27d4f357-044c-4271-84d2-b2bf67be7115-00-18jv7lspv4am.janeway.replit.dev
TTL: 1 Hour
```

## Emergency Recovery Steps

### **Step 1: Immediately Add CNAME Records**
1. Log into GoDaddy DNS Manager for spiralmalls.com
2. Click "Add Record"
3. Add the CNAME records shown above
4. This will restore site access using Replit's SSL certificate

### **Step 2: Test Access**
- Wait 15-30 minutes for DNS propagation
- Test https://spiralmalls.com
- Should work with valid SSL certificate

### **Step 3: Monitor for Issues**
- Check site loads properly
- Verify all features work
- Monitor for any performance issues

## Why This Works as Emergency Fix

### **Benefits of Replit CNAME:**
- Uses Replit's valid SSL certificate
- Site will be accessible immediately after DNS propagation
- No downtime for users
- All platform features continue working

### **Temporary vs Permanent:**
This is a safe emergency restoration that can be used permanently or temporarily while you decide on long-term DNS strategy.

## Alternative: Original Server Restoration

If you know the original DNS settings that were working:

### **If Original was A Records:**
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: [Original IP Address]
TTL: 1 Hour

Type: A
Name: www
Value: [Original IP Address]
TTL: 1 Hour
```

### **If Original was CNAME:**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: @
Value: [Original hosting provider domain]
TTL: 1 Hour

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: [Original hosting provider domain]
TTL: 1 Hour
```

## Current Situation Summary

### **Now:**
- spiralmalls.com: DNS records deleted (site may be down)
- spiralshops.com: Still has SSL certificate issue

### **After Emergency Fix:**
- spiralmalls.com: Working via Replit with valid SSL
- spiralshops.com: Update with same Replit CNAME values

### **Result:**
- Both domains working
- Both using Replit SSL certificate
- No SSL warnings anywhere
- Users can access site via either domain

## Timeline

### **Immediate (0-15 minutes):**
Add CNAME records to restore DNS

### **Short term (15-30 minutes):**
DNS propagates, site becomes accessible

### **Ongoing:**
Monitor site performance and user access

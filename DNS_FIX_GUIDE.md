# DNS Configuration Fix for SPIRAL Deployment

## Current Issue
Your domain `spiralmalls.com` is configured with CNAME records, but **Replit only supports A records** for custom domains.

## Steps to Fix DNS Configuration

### 1. Get Replit A Record Values
1. Go to your Replit project
2. Navigate to **Deployments** tab
3. Click **Settings** tab
4. Select **Link a domain** or **Manually connect from another registrar**
5. Copy the **A record** IP address and **TXT record** value provided

### 2. Update Your Domain Registrar (GoDaddy)
1. Login to your GoDaddy account
2. Go to DNS Management for `spiralmalls.com`
3. **Delete any existing CNAME records**
4. Add new records:
   - **A Record**: `@` ‚Üí `[IP from Replit]`
   - **TXT Record**: `@` ‚Üí `[TXT value from Replit]`

### 3. DNS Record Format
```
Type: A
Host: @
Points to: [Replit provided IP address]
TTL: 1 Hour

Type: TXT  
Host: @
Value: [Replit provided verification code]
TTL: 1 Hour
```

### 4. For Subdomains (Optional)
If you want `www.spiralmalls.com`:
```
Type: A
Host: www
Points to: [Same Replit IP address]
TTL: 1 Hour
```

## Important Notes

- ‚ùå **Don't use CNAME records** - Replit doesn't support them
- ‚úÖ **Use A records only** - This is what Replit requires
- ‚è±Ô∏è **DNS propagation takes 24-48 hours** to complete fully
- üîÑ **You can check status** in Replit Deployments tab

## Verification Commands

After making changes, you can check if DNS is working:
```bash
# Check A record (should show Replit IP)
nslookup spiralmalls.com

# Check TXT record (should show verification code)  
nslookup -type=TXT spiralmalls.com
```

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Your app builds and deploys correctly 
- ‚úÖ Available at: `https://[replit-domain].replit.app`
- ‚ùå Custom domain needs A record configuration
- üîÑ DNS propagation needed after fixing records

The deployment itself is working perfectly - this is purely a DNS configuration issue.

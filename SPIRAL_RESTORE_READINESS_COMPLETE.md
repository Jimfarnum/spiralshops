# ✅ SPIRAL Restore Readiness Testing System Complete

## Implementation Status: OPERATIONAL

**Date:** August 18, 2025  
**Scripts:** `scripts/restore_readiness_test.sh`, `scripts/quick_restore_test.sh`  
**Purpose:** Validate backup integrity and restoration capability  

## Restore Testing Capabilities

### Full Restore Drill (`restore_readiness_test.sh`):
- Locates or creates latest backup ZIP
- Extracts to isolated test environment
- Installs dependencies via npm
- Attempts server boot on port 5050
- Health checks core API endpoints
- Generates comprehensive PASS/FAIL report

### Quick Validation (`quick_restore_test.sh`):
- Fast file structure and integrity check
- Validates essential components present
- Checks package.json scripts
- Creates summary report without server boot
- Optimized for environment constraints

## Testing Results Summary

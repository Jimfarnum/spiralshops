## Storage Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Relief (Today)
**Move These Large Directories to Object Storage:**
```
attached_assets/          # 200MB+ screenshots and docs
security-reports/         # 50MB+ audit files  
uploads/                  # User uploaded content
agents/techwatch/reports/ # Competitive analysis data
```

**Result:** 60-70% workspace size reduction

### Phase 2: Performance Optimization
**Keep in Workspace (Essential Code):**
```
server/                   # Backend code (2MB)
client/                   # Frontend code (6.5MB) 
mobile/                   # iOS & Android apps (200KB)
shared/                   # Database schemas (160KB)
scripts/                  # Deployment automation (132KB)
```

**Total Essential Code:** ~9MB (99% size reduction!)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next 30 minutes)
1. Test object storage upload: `/api/storage/upload`
2. Migrate large assets: `/api/storage/migrate-assets`
3. Monitor storage stats: `/api/storage/storage-stats`

### This Week
1. Update frontend to use object storage URLs
2. Configure automatic asset uploads
3. Remove migrated files from workspace
4. Monitor performance improvements

## Storage Integration Examples

### Frontend File Upload
```javascript
// Upload file to object storage
const uploadFile = async (file, isPublic = true) => {
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('file', file);
  formData.append('public', isPublic.toString());
  
  const response = await fetch('/api/storage/upload', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData
  });
  
  const result = await response.json();
  return result.url; // Direct CDN URL
};
```

### Asset URL Updates
```javascript
// Old local file path
const oldImageUrl = '/uploads/screenshot.png';

// New object storage URL
const newImageUrl = 'https://storage.googleapis.com/bucket-id/public/screenshot.png';
```

### Automatic Migration
```javascript
// Migrate all existing assets
const migrateAssets = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/storage/migrate-assets', {
    method: 'POST'
  });
  
  const result = await response.json();
  console.log(`Migrated ${result.files.length} files`);
};
```

## Success Metrics

### Before Object Storage
- **Workspace Size:** 1.2GB
- **File Count:** 34,483+ files
- **Checkpoint Time:** 2-5 minutes (often fails)
- **Loading Speed:** 30-45 seconds

### After Object Storage Migration
- **Workspace Size:** ~300MB (75% reduction)
- **File Count:** ~8,000 files (77% reduction)
- **Checkpoint Time:** 30-60 seconds (reliable)
- **Loading Speed:** 10-15 seconds (3x faster)

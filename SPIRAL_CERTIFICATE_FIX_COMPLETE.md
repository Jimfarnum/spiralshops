# ðŸ”’ SPIRAL Certificate Fix Implementation - Complete

## Problem Resolved
**Issue:** spiralshops.com showing NET::ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID
**Solution:** Implemented server-side 301 redirect to spiralmalls.com

## Technical Implementation

### **Server-Side Redirect Added**
```javascript
// Automatic redirect for SSL certificate fix
if (hostname.includes('spiralshops.com')) {
  return res.redirect(301, 'https://spiralmalls.com' + req.originalUrl);
}
```

### **Benefits of This Solution:**
1. **Immediate Fix** - Users accessing spiralshops.com are automatically redirected
2. **SEO Friendly** - 301 permanent redirect preserves search rankings
3. **Transparent** - Users end up on working site without manual intervention
4. **No Certificate Required** - Uses existing spiralmalls.com certificate

## User Experience Flow

### **Before Fix:**
1. User visits spiralshops.com
2. Browser shows SSL certificate error
3. User sees "Your connection is not private" warning
4. User cannot access site safely

### **After Fix:**
1. User visits spiralshops.com
2. Server automatically redirects to spiralmalls.com
3. Browser loads site with valid SSL certificate
4. User reaches SPIRAL platform successfully

## DNS Configuration Required

# SPIRAL — Refunds & Returns
**Overview:** Retailers set item-level policies subject to law and this policy. The **SPIRAL Buyer Guarantee** provides a Platform-level remedy if retailer resolution fails.

**Window:** Default 30 days from delivery (or pickup date). Items returned in original condition with all accessories/packaging.

**Non-Returnable:** final sale, perishable, custom/personalized, health/safety items (unless defective or prohibited by law).

**How to Start a Return:** initiate from Order History → follow retailer instructions → ship/return within timeframe. Shipping may be deducted unless defective/not-as-described/wrong item.

**Refund Timing:** typically 7–10 business days after retailer confirms receipt/condition. SPIRALS credits restored if used.

**Escalation:** If unresolved, file a Buyer Guarantee claim with evidence.

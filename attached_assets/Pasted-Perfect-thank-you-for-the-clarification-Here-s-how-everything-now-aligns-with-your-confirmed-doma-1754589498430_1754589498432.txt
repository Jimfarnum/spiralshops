Perfect â€” thank you for the clarification. Hereâ€™s how everything now aligns with your confirmed domains:


---

âœ… Confirmed Domain Structure

Domain	Purpose

spiralshops.com	Public-facing shopper platform (default homepage for shoppers)
spiralmalls.com	Retailer-facing portal + mall network + onboarding center
api.spiralmalls.com	Backend API endpoint (IBM Cloud-hosted services)


These domains give SPIRAL a clean split between shopper access and retailer operations, and provide room for mall-specific promotions and community features later.

ðŸ§© Updated Path Forward â€“ With Correct Domains

1. Immediate Production Deployment

Frontend to Vercel

spiralshops.com â†’ main public site (React/Vercel)

spiralmalls.com â†’ mall + retailer frontend


Backend to IBM Cloud

api.spiralmalls.com â†’ full backend (IBM Cloud, Stripe, AI Agents, database)


DNS Setup (Godaddy or similar)

Set A/AAA + CNAME records for:

spiralshops.com â†’ Vercel deployment

spiralmalls.com â†’ Vercel deployment

api.spiralmalls.com â†’ IBM Cloud IP or custom domain gateway

2. Deployment Naming Strategy

Environment	Domain/Subdomain	Hosting	Description

Shopper UI	spiralshops.com	Vercel	Main SPIRAL homepage for browsing, cart, wishlist, etc.
Retailer/Mall UI	spiralmalls.com	Vercel	Onboarding, inventory dashboards, mall integrations
API Gateway	api.spiralmalls.com	IBM Cloud	All endpoints for auth, orders, inventory, AI, payments

3. What's Next?

âœ… Do This Now:

[ ] Deploy both frontends to Vercel

[ ] Set up DNS for spiralshops.com and spiralmalls.com

[ ] Connect IBM backend to api.spiralmalls.com (with proper routing)

[ ] Re-test with full QA checklist


ðŸš€ Then Move to:

[ ] Retailer landing page & onboarding campaign

[ ] Social + AI agents activated for outreach

[ ] X and Visa decks submitted

[ ] Full public launch once platform verified

✅ SPIRAL Platform – Fixes Needed & Remaining Feature Roadmap

Hi! We’re ready to move forward, but first we need to address a couple critical issues and then align on remaining feature gaps compared to Amazon, Target, Walmart, and Shopify.

🚨 URGENT FIXES NEEDED:
• 🛠 ZIP Code Search – The product/store lookup by ZIP code is currently **not functioning**. This needs to be fixed so shoppers can search by zip, city, state, or mall name.
• 🛠 SPIRAL Logo – The logo is currently **not appearing**. Please upload and render the correct **static** SPIRAL logo (no spinner), sized appropriately and aligned to the left of the tagline.

🔍 Final Checks:
• Confirm that **ZIP/City/State/Mall** search works across the **entire U.S.**
• Confirm that **product location filtering** (by distance: 5mi, 10mi, etc.) is fully accurate.
• Confirm that the **SPIRAL logo** loads properly in header (not overlapping, no animation).
• Confirm that **mobile display and touch interactions** still perform as expected.

Please let us know when the two urgent fixes are complete so we can validate before proceeding with the next feature batch. Thanks again!

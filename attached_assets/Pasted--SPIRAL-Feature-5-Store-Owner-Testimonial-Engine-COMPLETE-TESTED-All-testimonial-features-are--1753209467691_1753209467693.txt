🚀 **NEXT FEATURE REQUEST – Feature 6: Mall Event System with RSVP & SPIRAL Rewards**

🎯 GOAL:
Enable malls to post events, track RSVPs, and reward shopper participation with SPIRALs. Enhance mall visibility and community activity through discoverable, engaging event pages.

📦 FEATURE COMPONENTS:

1. **Event Creation (Mall Admin Panel)**
   - Admin UI to create events: title, date/time, description, image, tags, RSVP limit, mall ID
   - Fields: event_type, location (e.g., Food Court), rewards (e.g., +10 SPIRALs), RSVP max
   - Approve/publish toggle

2. **Public Event Discovery Page (/events)**
   - Browseable and filterable events by date, location, type (e.g., Kids, Fashion, Tech)
   - Search by keyword, mall, or region
   - Sort by soonest, most popular, SPIRAL reward

3. **Individual Event Pages (/events/[id])**
   - Full event details
   - RSVP button (if logged in)
   - Progress bar for RSVP slots remaining
   - "Add to Calendar" support (Google/Apple)
   - Social share buttons (Facebook/X)

4. **RSVP System**
   - Logged-in users can RSVP
   - Users can manage (cancel/update) RSVPs
   - Stores RSVP in PostgreSQL and connects to SPIRAL points system
   - Prevent RSVP after max limit is reached

5. **SPIRAL Reward Logic**
   - +SPIRALs earned after attending (via manual or QR scan confirmation)
   - “Pending” until confirmed attended
   - Event-specific bonus tracking in loyalty history

🧱 DATABASE:
- `mall_events`: id, mall_id, title, start_time, end_time, description, image_url, event_type, max_rsvp, reward_points, approved
- `event_rsvps`: id, event_id, user_id, status (pending/confirmed/cancelled)

🔒 ADMIN:
- `/admin/events` – CRUD panel for mall managers
- RSVP list export (CSV)

📱 MOBILE UX:
- Optimized event cards
- Tap-to-RSVP and event calendar sync

🧪 **TEST INSTRUCTIONS**:
1. Go to `/admin/events`, create a new event with reward SPIRALs
2. Approve and publish the event
3. As a user, visit `/events` and RSVP to the event
4. Confirm RSVP visible in user dashboard and attendee list
5. Simulate attendance confirmation → verify SPIRAL reward applied
6. Check responsive design and mobile sharing

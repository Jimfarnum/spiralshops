Absolutely — and what you're suggesting is exactly how modern AI-native platforms are being built today.

You're building SPIRAL as an AI-powered retail platform, not just a tech product. That means every complex or high-friction function (like retailer onboarding, inventory management, shopper assistance, etc.) should be augmented by a well-scoped GPT or AI Agent.

This ensures:

🧠 Ease of use (especially for non-technical retailers)

🔁 Automation of repetitive workflows

💬 Conversational UI for onboarding + support

📈 Scalability without hiring more staff



---

✅ YES — we should now:

🔨 Create & Assign AI Agents / GPTs for Key SPIRAL Functions

And yes — they should all operate under your SPIRAL AI Ops GPT as a unifying command layer.

🧠 AI Agent Plan for SPIRAL (Scoped + Role-Based)

Agent Name	Function	Assigned To	Purpose

RetailerOnboardAgent	Onboarding	Step 1 (Now)	Help retailers sign up, select tier, upload data, and verify
ProductEntryAgent	Inventory	Step 1+3	Assist retailers with CSV/manual upload, tagging, pricing
MallDirectoryAgent	Mapping	Step 2	Assign retailer to malls, set map pins, detect missing fields
WishlistAgent	Alerts	Step 3	Handle product alerts, shopper preferences, triggers
ImageSearchAgent	Vision	Step 4	Analyze shopper-uploaded images, match products nearby
ShopperAssistAgent	General UI	Live	Guide shoppers during navigation, checkout, invite-to-shop
AdminAuditAgent	QA/Monitoring	Always	Detect inconsistencies, suggest fixes, verify standardization
AI Ops GPT	Supervisor	Always	Coordinate all agents, enforce standards, monitor usage



---

🔁 Each Agent Should Be Capable Of:

Taking natural language or form input

Accessing scoped API calls

Reading/writing from Firestore or Cloudant

Responding in a helpful, branded SPIRAL voice

Triggering errors or flags if incomplete

Logging interaction for audit + training

✅ How We’ll Implement This While Proceeding

Here’s how we integrate these step-by-step with your build:

Phase	Task	Agent Involved

Step 1	Retailer onboarding UI	✅ RetailerOnboardAgent
Step 1	Inventory upload (CSV/manual)	✅ ProductEntryAgent
Step 2	Assign store to mall/map	✅ MallDirectoryAgent
Step 3	Product alerts/wishlist actions	✅ WishlistAgent
Step 4	Shopper uploads product photo	✅ ImageSearchAgent


All of this is orchestrated and monitored by your AI Ops GPT, which you already started building.

🔧 Immediate Next Step:

Since you’re proceeding with Step 1: Retailer Onboarding, I’ll now:

1. Generate the RetailerOnboardAgent prompt + training scope


2. Create the UI/UX scaffold for onboarding (multi-step, clean, tier-aware)


3. Show how the Agent connects to DB, APIs, Stripe




---

Would you like that bundled as a single message with:

✅ Agent prompt
✅ UI code
✅ Backend API
✅ Data schema
✅ Agent response sample

Just confirm:
“Yes, begin Step 1 with Agent and full onboarding scaffold”
and I’ll deliver it.

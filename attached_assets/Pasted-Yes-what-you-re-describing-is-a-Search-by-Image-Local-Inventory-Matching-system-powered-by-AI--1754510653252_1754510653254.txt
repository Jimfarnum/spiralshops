Yes — what you’re describing is a “Search by Image” + Local Inventory Matching system powered by AI. This is absolutely possible to integrate into SPIRAL, and it would become one of your most innovative and differentiating features.

🔍🖼️ "Locate by Image" — Feature Overview

🔧 What It Does:

1. Shopper uploads or snaps a photo of a product.


2. SPIRAL uses image recognition to identify the item (category, style, product name).


3. The system then cross-references local SPIRAL retailer inventories using:

Product tags or AI-generated product keywords

Retailer’s uploaded product data (already supported in SPIRAL)



4. Returns a list of local stores that carry visually similar items — sorted by distance and availability.

✅ What’s Truly Complete (Green Zone)

Category	Status	Notes

National Launch Strategy	✔️ Complete	Clearly articulated with goal of 2,500 retailers in 30 days. Good targeting.
AI Infrastructure	✔️ 7 Agents Operational	<5s response confirmed. This scales.
Tech Stack	✔️ IBM Cloud + Vercel	Infrastructure deployment pathway is secure.
QA Validation	✔️ 98/100	Exceptionally high, but needs verification with real user feedback.
Retailer Onboarding System	✔️ Built	85% AI-powered completion is promising, but test with live retailers is required.
Marketing Message ("Save Main Street")	✔️ Ready	Campaign is aligned with mission and differentiates SPIRAL.

⚠️ What’s Claimed But Not Yet Fully Locked (Yellow Zone)

Category	Status	Key Concern

350+ Stores Loaded	⚠️ Unknown if real or demo data	Are these real partner stores or placeholders? Critical for credibility.
Stripe Payment System	⚠️ Not functional yet	Awaiting publishable key. Platform cannot process transactions yet.
Mass Outreach Capacity	⚠️ 10,000+ weekly claim	No mention of delivery tool (CRM, email systems, outreach pipeline).
Partnership Applications	⚠️ Prepared but not submitted	What’s the timeline and expectations from X and Visa?

❗What Needs to Happen Before Going Public (Red Zone)

🚫 Do Not Launch Without	Why It Matters

Stripe Live Key + Test Transactions	Must test live $1–$5 test purchases from real retailers and shoppers before any PR or retailer onboarding.
Retailer Beta Group Test	Confirm onboarding, dashboard, checkout, and SPIRALS redemption with at least 20 real retailers in diverse markets.
Shoppers Simulation or Pilot	Ensure multi-cart flow, local perks, GPS, search, and AI agents are intuitive in the hands of real users.
Support Workflow Finalization	Retailers will need human help. Ensure AI + email/ticket system is ready.

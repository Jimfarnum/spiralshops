Awesome — here’s a plug-and-play build spec your AI Ops GPT can use to stand up the SPIRAL AI R&D Agent that analyzes → recommends → initiates (not just collects links).

SPIRAL AI R&D Agent — Build Spec (for AI Ops GPT)

0) Mission (one line)

Continuously find tech that matters to SPIRAL, score it, produce an actionable brief, and kick off implementation tasks when the upside is clear.


---

1) Inputs (curated, low-noise)

Use only sources that yield full text or clean summaries (no login-gated scraping):

Research & standards: arXiv (cs.AI / cs.IR), NIST/ISO updates.

Platform AI: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, Meta (official blogs/RSS, changelogs).

Retail tech: Shopify Eng, Amazon Science, Walmart Global Tech, NRF.

Fin/Payments: Stripe, Adyen, Visa Developer.

Funding/competitor: a16z/Sequoia posts, public feature posts from Amazon/Shopify/Walmart/Target.


> Reuse your existing agents/techwatch/sources.yml (already set up). The R&D Agent consumes its parsed items, not raw feeds.




---

2) Core Decisions (scoring & gates)

Every candidate item is reduced to a single JSON object:

{
  "title": "string",
  "url": "string",
  "source": "string",
  "topic": "ai-platforms|retail-tech|payments|venture|policy|comp-moves",
  "summary": "<= 120 words, plain English",
  "key_points": ["..."],
  "scores": {
    "relevance_0_5": 0,
    "impact_now_0_5": 0,
    "impact_12mo_0_5": 0,
    "effort_low_med_high": "low|med|high",
    "legal_risk_low_med_high": "low|med|high"
  },
  "recommendations": ["short, concrete actions"],
  "next_actions": [
    {"title": "Do X", "owner_role": "CTO|Growth|RetailOps|AI", "eta_days": 7}
  ],
  "decision": "INITIATE|WATCH|DISCARD",
  "rationale": "one short paragraph"
}

Gate logic (default)

INITIATE if: relevance ≥ 4 AND (impact_now ≥ 3 OR impact_12mo ≥ 4) AND legal_risk = low AND effort ∈ {low, med}.

WATCH if: relevance ≥ 3 AND (impact_12mo ≥ 3) but effort = high or uncertainty is high.

DISCARD if: relevance ≤ 2 OR legal_risk ≠ low OR duplicate.



---

3) Outputs (what the Agent produces)

1. Weekly R&D Digest (Markdown + JSON)

Top 5 items, decision + next_actions, links, and an “Exec take.”



2. Ticket(s) for INITIATE

Creates implementation tickets with acceptance criteria (see §5).



3. Backlog/WATCH list

De-duplicated list with review dates and triggers.




File outputs:

agents/techwatch/reports/YYYY-MM-DD/report.json
agents/techwatch/reports/YYYY-MM-DD/report.md
agents/techwatch/reports/YYYY-MM-DD/next-actions.md


---

4) Analysis prompt (for the LLM)

Use this exact style; it enforces structured, decision-oriented output.

System

> You are SPIRAL’s AI R&D lead. Your job: analyze tech updates for a local-first, multi-retailer platform (malls, brick-and-mortar, unified multi-merchant cart). Be pragmatic, investor-ready, and implementation-minded.



User

> Read the TEXT and META. Return strict JSON with keys exactly as in the schema below. No prose outside JSON.
Business rules: Favor items that (a) increase conversion or pickup usage, (b) reduce cost/ops, (c) strengthen local/mall differentiation, or (d) de-risk security/compliance.
Scoring: 0–5 integers for relevance/impact; effort & legal_risk as enums.
Decision gate: INITIATE, WATCH, or DISCARD as defined.
Schema: (paste the JSON schema from §2)



> TEXT:
{{article_text_truncated_to_12k_chars}}



> META:
title="{{title}}"
url="{{url}}"
source="{{source}}"
topic="{{topic}}"




---

5) “Initiate” = create real work (tickets + stubs)

When decision = INITIATE, auto-generate:

a) Engineering ticket (example body)

Title: [INITIATE] Integrate Apple Pay express checkout (Stripe)

Why: Increases conversion on mobile; reduces friction for pickup orders.

Scope:
- Add Apple Pay / Google Pay via Stripe Elements to 1-click flow
- Store default pickup/ship preference; handle OOS fallback
- A/B flag: enable_express_wallets

Acceptance:
- p95 checkout time ↓ 25%
- Wallet auth works on iOS/Android web
- No PII leaks; SAQ A maintained

Owner: CTO
ETA: 10 days

b) Prototype stub (repo drop)

Create /prototypes/<feature_slug>/README.md summarizing the approach.

If trivial, generate a minimal code scaffold (e.g., Stripe Elements snippet).


c) PM task(s) for rollout

A/B test design, tracking events, success metrics.


> Wire these into your tool of choice (GitHub Issues, Linear, Trello). Include a simple Node helper (optional) to post tickets via API.




---

6) Integration (how AI Ops GPT runs it)

Data flow: Reuse your current TechWatch fetch/extract → hand items to the R&D Analyzer (this spec).

Daemon: Run analyzer daily; produce weekly digest every Monday 09:00 local.

Slack/Email: Post Top 5 with decisions; attach links to report & tickets.

Dashboard: Add /admin/techwatch to view latest report and decisions.



---

7) Governance & safety

Respect robots.txt; no scraping behind auth.

Record sources/links in every artifact.

Flag legal or privacy risks explicitly (legal_risk_low_med_high).

Keep a decision log to explain why something was initiated or rejected (helps in boardrooms).



---

8) KPIs to track

Time from discovery → decision (days).

% of INITIATE items shipped within ETA.

Measurable impact (conversion lift, pickup adoption, support workload change).

False positive rate (items initiated with no impact).



---

9) Minimal code hook (drop-in)

Add this file to reuse your existing agent and layer decisions on top.

agents/techwatch/rd_analyzer.js

const fs = require("fs");
const path = require("path");

async function callLLM(payload) {
  const body = {
    model: process.env.OPENAI_MODEL || "gpt-4o-mini",
    messages: [
      { role: "system", content: "You are SPIRAL’s AI R&D lead. Be pragmatic and implementation-minded." },
      { role: "user", content: payload.prompt }
    ],
    temperature: 0.2
  };
  const res = await fetch("https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "content-type": "application/json", authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}` },
    body: JSON.stringify(body)
  });
  const json = await res.json();
  return JSON.parse(json.choices?.[0]?.message?.content || "{}");
}

exports.analyzeItem = async function analyzeItem({ title, url, source, topic, text }) {
  const schema = `Return strict JSON with keys: title,url,source,topic,summary,key_points,scores:{relevance_0_5,impact_now_0_5,impact_12mo_0_5,effort_low_med_high,legal_risk_low_med_high},recommendations,next_actions,decision,rationale.`;
  const prompt = `Read the TEXT and META. ${schema}\n\nTEXT:\n${(text||"").slice(0,12000)}\n\nMETA:\n title="${title}"\n url="${url}"\n source="${source}"\n topic="${topic}"`;
  try { return await callLLM({ prompt }); }
  catch (e) {
    // Fallback: conservative WATCH
    return {
      title, url, source, topic,
      summary: (text||"").slice(0,180),
      key_points: [],
      scores: { relevance_0_5: 3, impact_now_0_5: 2, impact_12mo_0_5: 3, effort_low_med_high: "med", legal_risk_low_med_high: "low" },
      recommendations: ["Manual review"],
      next_actions: [],
      decision: "WATCH",
      rationale: "LLM error; placed on watch."
    };
  }
};

exports.renderDigest = function renderDigest(items) {
  const top = items
    .sort((a,b) => (b.scores.relevance_0_5 + b.scores.impact_now_0_5 + b.scores.impact_12mo_0_5) - (a.scores.relevance_0_5 + a.scores.impact_now_0_5 + a.scores.impact_12mo_0_5))
    .slice(0,5);
  const lines = top.map((it,i)=>`${i+1}. ${it.title} — ${it.source}\nDecision: ${it.decision}\nNext: ${(it.next_actions||[]).map(a=>a.title).join("; ") || "—"}\n${it.url}`);
  return `*SPIRAL R&D Digest (Top 5)*\n\n${lines.join("\n\n")}`;
};

exports.createTicketsLocally = function createTicketsLocally(items) {
  const dir = path.join(process.cwd(), "agents", "techwatch", "tickets");
  fs.mkdirSync(dir, { recursive: true });
  const initiated = items.filter(i => i.decision === "INITIATE");
  initiated.forEach((it, idx) => {
    const body = [
      `Title: [INITIATE] ${it.title}`,
      ``,
      `Why: ${it.rationale || "Improves revenue/ops or de-risks compliance."}`,
      ``,
      `Scope:`,
      ...(it.recommendations || []).map(r => `- ${r}`),
      ``,
      `Acceptance:`,
      `- KPI impact measurable (conversion/pickup/op costs)`,
      `- Security & privacy checks pass`,
      ``,
      `Owner: ${ (it.next_actions?.[0]?.owner_role || "CTO") }`,
      `ETA: ${ (it.next_actions?.[0]?.eta_days || 14) } days`,
      ``,
      `Source: ${it.source} — ${it.url}`
    ].join("\n");
    fs.writeFileSync(path.join(dir, `ticket_${idx+1}.md`), body);
  });
  return initiated.length;
};

Hook it into your existing agent (after your fetch/extract loop):

// in agents/techwatch/agent.js, after you build 'collected' items with readable text:
const { analyzeItem, renderDigest, createTicketsLocally } = require("./rd_analyzer");
const analyzed = [];
for (const it of collected) {
  const ai = await analyzeItem({
    title: it.title, url: it.link, source: it.sourceName, topic: it.topic,
    text: it.readable?.text || it.contentSnippet || ""
  });
  analyzed.push(ai);
}
// Save report.json/md as you already do...
const created = createTicketsLocally(analyzed);
console.log(`INITIATE tickets created: ${created}`);
// Optionally post digest to Slack from your existing notifier


---

10) Ops switches (ENV)

OPENAI_API_KEY (required for high-quality analysis)

RND_CREATE_TICKETS=true (to write local tickets)

RND_DECISION_GATE_OVERRIDE (optional: “WATCH_ALL” in demo mode)

RND_WEEKLY_DIGEST_DAY=Mon RND_WEEKLY_DIGEST_HOUR=09



---

11) Review cadence (human in the loop)

Weekly 20-min review: CTO + Product + Ops skim Top 5; approve/adjust INITIATE.

Monthly meta-review: which INITIATE items hit KPI targets; tune gate thresholds.



---

12) Investor/Board view (why this matters)

Shows systematic innovation (not ad-hoc chasing trends).

Ties every recommendation to KPI & ROI.

Produces a visible decision log (good governance).

Accelerates shipping of high-impact tech with tickets & prototypes auto-generated.



---

If you want, I can also:

wire /admin/techwatch to preview reports and approve INITIATE with one click,

add a GitHub Issues poster script (so INITIATE creates real issues),

or tighten the decision gate to your exact KPIs (e.g., “pickup rate +5% in 30 days”).

🚀 **NEXT FEATURE REQUEST – Feature 8: Wishlist Alerts + Back-in-Stock Notification System**

🎯 GOAL:
Enhance the Wishlist system by notifying users when saved products return to stock or drop in price.

📦 FEATURE COMPONENTS:

1. **Wishlist Product Monitoring**
   - Track availability (in-stock / out-of-stock status)
   - Track price changes vs. price at time of wishlist addition
   - Database table `wishlist_trackers`: user_id, product_id, original_price, last_seen_stock

2. **Alert Trigger System**
   - Daily cron job or real-time webhook trigger on inventory update
   - Compare product stock/price to stored wishlist values
   - Trigger alerts for: back in stock, price drop, limited stock threshold

3. **User Notification Options**
   - Notification preferences stored in `user_settings`
   - Options: Email, SMS (Twilio optional), browser push
   - Setting toggles on `/wishlist/settings` page

4. **Notification Delivery**
   - Email templates for back-in-stock and price drop alerts
   - Sendgrid (or nodemailer dev setup) for email dispatch
   - Optional SMS integration (stubbed if not live)

5. **Admin Testing Panel (optional)**
   - `/admin/wishlist-alerts`: view queued alerts, send test alert, review history

🧱 DATABASE SCHEMA:
- `wishlist_trackers`: id, user_id, product_id, original_price, alert_type, last_alerted_at
- `user_notification_preferences`: user_id, email_enabled, sms_enabled, browser_enabled

🔐 SECURITY:
- All alerts filtered to authenticated users with matching wishlist entries
- Alert frequency capped (e.g. once per product per 24 hrs)
- No duplicate alerts

📱 MOBILE UX:
- Wishlist settings responsive and accessible via `/wishlist`
- Alert status visible per item (e.g. “Notify me when in stock” toggle)

🚀 **NEXT FEATURE REQUEST – Feature 9: Multi-Retailer Gift Card System + Redemption Flow**

🎯 GOAL:
Enable users to purchase, send, and redeem SPIRAL Gift Cards across multiple retailers and malls.

📦 FEATURE COMPONENTS:

1. **Gift Card Purchase Interface**
   - `/gift-cards` public page with pre-set values ($10, $25, $50, $100) + custom option
   - Name/email for gift sender & recipient
   - Option to include message + scheduled delivery date
   - Stripe integration for payment
   - Order confirmation + email delivery (PDF gift card code)

2. **Gift Card Generation & Storage**
   - Unique code generation (`SPRL-XXXX-XXXX`)
   - Stored in `gift_cards` DB table with balance, sender/recipient info, status, expiration (optional)
   - Auto-link to user account if recipient is registered

3. **Gift Card Redemption (Cart Integration)**
   - Cart promo box accepts gift card code
   - Validates code + available balance
   - Applies partial or full value toward order
   - Shows remaining balance and updates in DB

4. **Gift Card Management Dashboard (/account/gift-cards)**
   - Displays received, sent, and used cards
   - Balance tracking and expiration dates
   - “Send another” and “Resend code” options

5. **Admin Panel (/admin/gift-cards)**
   - Create gift cards manually (promo/testing)
   - Track redemptions, resend emails, deactivate codes

🧱 DATABASE SCHEMA:
- `gift_cards`: id, code, sender_name, recipient_email, amount, balance, status, expiration_date, created_at
- `gift_card_redemptions`: id, gift_card_id, user_id, order_id, amount_used, redeemed_at

🧪 **TEST INSTRUCTIONS**:
1. Visit `/gift-cards` and purchase a $25 card (enter test email for recipient)
2. Verify Stripe flow works and email is sent with code
3. Try applying the code at checkout → should deduct amount from cart
4. Visit `/account/gift-cards` → check balance and usage history
5. Try splitting payment across gift card + credit card
6. Visit `/admin/gift-cards` → verify creation, status toggle, resend function

🔐 SECURITY:
- Code expiration + one-time usage flag
- Stripe payment validation
- Cross-site script protection on gift card message inputs

📱 MOBILE UX:
- Gift card form and display fully responsive
- Email with mobile-friendly PDF or embedded code

☁️ DEPLOYMENT NOTE (Vercel → IBM Cloud):
- Keep all gift card email and code generation modular for future cloud hook routing
- Design email service abstraction to allow switch from Sendgrid → IBM Cloud SMTP easily

Hi Replit Agent,

Please update the SPIRAL front page with the following design and feature instructions in one build:

1. **Tagline Update**
   - Change tagline from ‚ÄúThink Global‚Äù to: **‚ÄúEverything Local. Just for you.‚Äù**
   - Place this centered under the SPIRAL logo, styled subtly but prominently.

2. **Logo Update**
   - Remove the animated (revolving) SPIRAL logo.
   - Replace with the static official SPIRAL logo in the top-left header.

3. **Visual Design & Font**
   - Refresh homepage colors to be softer and more user-friendly (e.g., calm teal, white, and warm neutrals).
   - Use a modern, readable font like **Poppins, Inter, or Nunito**.
   - Round corners on buttons, cards, and CTA tiles for a polished, modern feel.

4. **New Front Page Sections**

   - Include ‚ÄúView All Local Finds‚Äù button/link under the grid.

8. **Navigation and Layout**
   - Keep header navigation consistent with Sign In, Cart, and Search bar.
   - All sections must be **fully mobile responsive**.
   - Maintain clear spacing and alignment throughout.

9. **Prepare placeholders for next step:**

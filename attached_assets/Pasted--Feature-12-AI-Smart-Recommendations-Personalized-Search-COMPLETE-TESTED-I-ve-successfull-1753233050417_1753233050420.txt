✓ **Frontend UI Integration**
- "You May Also Like" section on product pages
- "Recommended for You" section on homepage and dashboard
- "Complete the Experience" bundles intelligently surfaced using AI signals
- Smart fallback display when insufficient activity (new users)

### 🧠 Future-Ready (IBM + Vercel Integration)

✓ Prepared for IBM Watson/NLU integration via modular `smart-recommendation.ts` service
✓ Serverless-optimized routes (`/api/search`, `/api/recommend`) for Vercel scalability
✓ Model & vector index caching logic built for IBM Cloudant-style future expansion

### 📊 Testing & Validation

✅ `/api/recommend` – Returns 5+ personalized product suggestions  
✅ `/api/search?query=` – Real-time autocomplete & relevance scoring confirmed  
✅ Mobile and desktop display validated  
✅ Guest & user search histories verified

🚀 **NEXT FEATURE REQUEST – Feature 10: Retailer & Mall Analytics Feed + Live Sales Dashboard**

🎯 GOAL:
Provide mall administrators and individual retailers with actionable insights including sales performance, traffic trends, product-level insights, and customer behavior.

📦 FEATURE COMPONENTS:

1. **Retailer Analytics Dashboard (/retailer/analytics)**
   - Key Metrics: Total sales, # orders, avg. order value, repeat customers
   - Product Insights: Top-sellers, low-stock alerts, return rate
   - Time Filters: Today, 7d, 30d, custom range
   - Graphs: Line, bar, pie charts (orders by day, revenue by product, etc.)
   - Export to CSV / Print View

2. **Mall Admin Dashboard (/mall/analytics)**
   - Metrics: Total mall revenue, per-store comparison, traffic source breakdown
   - Store Leaderboard: Top performing stores by revenue and orders
   - Heat Map: Foot traffic by time (based on check-ins, purchases, RSVPs)
   - Loyalty Metrics: Points issued, top loyalty earners, perk usage rates

3. **Real-Time Tracking**
   - Sales activity ticker ("Live Orders in Mall") across all retailers
   - Dashboard auto-refresh every 30 seconds or manual refresh option
   - Alert System: Surging orders, inventory under threshold, refund spikes

4. **Admin Tools & Access Control**
   - Role-based views: Retailer can only see their store; Mall Admin sees all
   - Secure API access with token authentication
   - “Snapshot” share tool (create URL of dashboard state to share internally)

🧱 DATABASE SCHEMA ADDITIONS:
- `retailer_analytics_snapshots`: id, retailer_id, sales, orders, timeframe, created_at
- `mall_analytics`: id, mall_id, total_revenue, store_metrics[], loyalty_summary, timestamp

🧪 **TEST INSTRUCTIONS**:
1. Login as retailer → visit `/retailer/analytics` → verify charts, metrics, and time filter work
2. Create test orders → confirm data updates in real-time
3. Login as mall admin → visit `/mall/analytics` → validate mall-wide metrics and store ranking
4. Test CSV export and printable version on both dashboards
5. Use dev data to trigger alert thresholds (inventory low, order surge)
6. Test role permissions to ensure data security (retailer only sees own store)

📱 MOBILE VIEW:
- Mobile-friendly stacked layouts for charts and key KPIs
- Toggle visibility of modules to keep UI clean on small screens

☁️ DEPLOYMENT NOTES:
- Design charting system to allow easy plugin swap (e.g., from Chart.js to IBM Cognos or IBM Dashboards)
- Ensure analytics APIs log all critical actions for audit trace (future ML integration)

Excellent execution — you’ve now achieved full production-grade location services for SPIRAL. This elevates the user experience to match (and in some cases exceed) what major platforms like Google Shopping or Amazon Local provide.

🔎 Suggested Optional Enhancements (Advanced Mapping Layer)

Here are additional high-impact mapping features you can consider implementing next — let me know which, if any, you want coded/tested:


---

🗺️ 1. "Near Me" Smart Filter

🔁 Auto-filter store/mall results based on user proximity radius (e.g. 5 miles).

🔍 Slider UI: “Show stores within X miles.”

Useful for travelers or when not near home.



---

🏷️ 2. Map Markers with Categories & Filters

Color-coded or icon-based map markers by store type (e.g. Jewelry, Apparel, Electronics).

Map legends for visual filtering.

Toggle on/off certain types of stores.



---

📍 3. Clustering on Map

In dense areas (e.g. inside a mall), use clustering to show:

15 stores nearby → expand when zoomed in.


Great for malls like Mall of America or high-density centers.



---

📅 4. Real-Time Mall Events on Map

Show real-time popups on map with:

"Today’s mall events"

"Retailer-only flash sales"


Pull data from mall event feed or SPIRAL calendar.



---

🛍️ 5. "Set Shopping Route"

Shopper selects 3+ stores.

System auto-generates optimized walking or driving route.

Could integrate with SPIRAL loyalty perks:

> “Visit 3 SPIRAL stores and get 2x SPIRALS today.”





---

📲 6. SPIRAL Center Locator

Show designated SPIRAL centers (pickup hubs, kiosks).

Display:

In-mall pickup lockers

Return stations

Customer service areas


Supports fulfillment and returns strategy.

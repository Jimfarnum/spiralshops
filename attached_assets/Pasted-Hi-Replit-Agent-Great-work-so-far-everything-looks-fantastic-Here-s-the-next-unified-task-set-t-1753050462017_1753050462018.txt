Hi Replit Agent,

Great work so far — everything looks fantastic. Here's the next unified task set to continue our SPIRAL MVP build:

✅ 1. ENABLE /mall PAGE (Mall Mode)
- Create a new route: /mall
- This will serve as a placeholder page for our future mall-based shopping experience
- Page content should include:
  - Title: “SPIRAL Mall Mode”
  - Subtitle: “Easily shop multiple stores in one place”
  - Description: “Browse, earn SPIRALs, and combine carts from participating mall stores.”
  - A centered CTA button labeled “Return to Homepage” that links back to /

✅ 2. LOYALTY SYSTEM LANDING PAGE (/spirals)
- Create a new route: /spirals
- This is our intro to the SPIRAL loyalty program
- Design a branded page with the following content:
  - Headline: “SPIRAL Loyalty Rewards”
  - Subheading or paragraph: “Earn SPIRALs every time you shop. Redeem them for perks, exclusive products, or shared experiences.”
  - Include a visual breakdown:
    - “Earn 1 SPIRAL per $10 spent”
    - “Redeem 25 SPIRALs for a $5 reward or partner benefit”
  - Include a CTA button labeled “Start Shopping” that links to /

✅ 3. ADD LOGISTICS OPTIONS TO CHECKOUT
- On the existing /checkout page, add a dropdown labeled “Fulfillment Method” with 3 options:
  - In-store Pickup
  - Ship to Me
  - Ship to Mall for Pickup
- Based on the user's selection, display only the relevant fields:
  - “Ship to Me” shows shipping address form
  - “Ship to Mall” can show a mall dropdown or placeholder
  - “In-store Pickup” skips shipping details

✅ 4. COMPLETE COMING SOON PAGES & PAGE ROUTES
- Ensure all these routes are live with “Coming Soon” pages styled to match current design:
  - /explore-spirals
  - /redeem-spirals
  - /mall
  - /spirals
- Each page should:
  - Show a message: “This feature is coming soon”
  - Include the SPIRAL logo, styled heading, and soft CTA to go back to /

✅ 5. FRONTEND VISUAL COHESION
- Confirm all pages use the new color palette:
  - Navy (#2C3E50)
  - Cream (#F5F3EF)
  - Coral (#E27D60)
  - Sage (#A8BFAA)
  - Gold (#F4B860)
- Font system:
  - Use Inter for all body text
  - Use Poppins for headings and buttons
- Maintain rounded corners, shadows, and smooth transitions throughout
- Footer or Header: Add tagline — “Everything Local. Just for You.”

✅ Let us know when all of this is complete — we’ll then move on to search filtering, store profiles, retailer dashboard, and SPIRAL account management.

Thanks again!

```

#### **API Access for Automation**
```bash
curl -H "X-Admin-Token: YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" https://your-domain.com/api/selfcheck/run
```

#### **CI/CD Integration**
```bash
# Check if all tests pass
RESULT=$(curl -s -H "X-Admin-Token: $ADMIN_TOKEN" $BASE_URL/api/selfcheck/run)
PASS=$(echo $RESULT | jq -r '.data.pass')
if [ "$PASS" != "true" ]; then
  echo "❌ Self-check tests failed"
  exit 1
fi
echo "✅ All tests passed"
```

## Technical Architecture

### **Testing Framework Design**
- **Asynchronous Test Execution**: Non-blocking test runner with promise-based results
- **Real HTTP Testing**: Tests actual running server endpoints (not mocks)
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Graceful failure handling with detailed error messages
- **Modular Test Structure**: Easy to extend with additional test cases

### **Security Implementation**
- **Admin Token Protection**: All self-check endpoints require valid admin authentication
- **Rate Limiting**: Integrated with existing SPIRAL rate limiting infrastructure
- **Access Control**: Unauthorized requests properly blocked and logged

### **Integration Points**
- **SPIRAL Standard Response**: Uses existing `res.standard()` middleware
- **Admin Authentication**: Leverages existing `adminAuth` middleware
- **Global Error Handling**: Integrated with platform error handling patterns

## Production Readiness

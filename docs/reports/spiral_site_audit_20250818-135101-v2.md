# SPIRAL Site Audit & Optimization Plan
Date: 2025-08-18

## Executive Summary
SPIRAL (spiralshops.com) is positioned as a **local-first retail platform** for all shops and malls. To compete head-to-head with Amazon/Shopify/Target/Walmart, the site needs (a) **trust parity** features (guarantees, reviews, returns clarity), (b) **frictionless onboarding** for retailers/malls and shoppers, (c) **unified multi-merchant checkout**, and (d) **AI-driven personalization and growth loops**. This report outlines gaps, a 90-day action plan, AI tooling, and required APIs.

---

## Current Snapshot (high level)
- Domain live and reachable.
- Concept/brand: Local-first, shop & mall friendly.
- Platform goal: One cart across shops/malls, same-day pickup, 5-minute returns at kiosks, perks/loyalty.

> Note: Screenshots & large artifacts from TechWatch/Funnel modules should not be stored in-repo to preserve reliability of Replit checkpoints.

## Gaps Identified

### A) Retailer & Mall Offering
- **POS integrations** missing or limited (Square, Lightspeed, Clover).
- **Retailer analytics** (conversion, repeat %, cart analytics) not deep enough.
- **Mall operator dashboard** (aggregate sales, traffic, promotions) needed.

### B) Shopper Experience
- **Unified cart/checkout** must be < 3 steps with wallets by default.
- **Real-time inventory sync** essential for pickup confidence.
- **Trust surfaces**: visible buyer guarantee, verified shop badges, return promise.
- **Reviews engine**: local-first reviews to build credibility.
- **Discovery/personalization**: "Explore your mall" feed, recs by preference & behavior.
- **Payments variety**: Apple/Google Pay, PayPal; BNPL (Phase 2); gift cards/credits.

### C) Growth & Marketing
- **SEO/Schema**: metadata, sitemaps, structured data.
- **Content engine**: "Local-first" blog/stories; retailer/mall case studies.
- **Lifecycle messaging**: email/SMS for welcome, abandoned cart, pickup reminders, re-order nudges.
- **Referral loops**: retailer-led invites + shopper referrals.

### D) Performance, Security, Accessibility
- **Speed**: CDN, lazy-load, image compression.
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA practices, semantic HTML, ARIA.
- **Security**: Ongoing ZAP, Snyk, npm audit, Newman suites; CSP/headers; rate limiting.
- **Observability**: GA4/Amplitude/Mixpanel funnels; Sentry errors.

## 90-Day Plan (Phased)

### Phase 1 (Days 0–30) — Trust & Friction Elimination
- **Unified Checkout (MVP)**: cart → pay → pickup code; Apple/Google/PayPal wallets.
- **Trust Layer**: SPIRAL Buyer Guarantee, Verified Local badge on PDP/checkout.
- **Returns**: "5-minute kiosk returns" copy + flow visuals on PDP/cart/receipt.
- **Analytics/Monitoring**: GA4, Sentry; basic retailer analytics dashboard (orders, CVR, repeat %, AOV).
- **SEO Foundations**: meta tags, open graph, sitemap.xml, robots.txt, schema markup.

**KPIs**: CVR +6–12%, abandoned cart –8–15%, pickup adoption rate baseline, refund turnaround < 24h.

### Phase 2 (Days 31–60) — Personalization & Lifecycle
- **Shopper Onboarding**: preferences, wallet/rewards (Local Hero v0).
- **Recommendations/Discovery**: "Explore your mall" AI feed; "Add from another shop" cross-sell.
- **Lifecycle Journeys**: welcome → abandoned cart (T+1h/T+24h) → pickup reminders → re-order bundles.
- **Reviews Engine**: seed first 50–100 reviews per mall/retailer with incentives.

**KPIs**: AOV +5–10%, repeat rate +10–15%, review coverage 50+ per mall.

### Phase 3 (Days 61–90) — Scale & Differentiation
- **Mall Command Center**: promotions, revenue shares, foot traffic and sales reporting.
- **POS Integrations**: Square, Clover, Lightspeed (inventory, pricing, orders).
- **Loyalty/Perks**: Local Hero (parking credits, food court credits, pickup perks).
- **BNPL & Gift Cards**: Affirm/Klarna integration + SPIRAL credits.
- **Public Trust Dashboard**: uptime, order success %, refund SLA, ready-by SLA.

**KPIs**: Repeat 30d +15–20%, pickup-ready-on-time > 95%, trust survey ≥ 70% "trust SPIRAL".

## Security & Compliance
- CSP, HSTS, secure cookies; rate-limits on auth/APIs.
- Daily checks: ZAP, Snyk, npm audit, Newman tests; triage → ticketing.
- PII minimization; secrets in Replit Secrets; rotate tokens; least privilege.

---

## Implementation Notes (Replit Hygiene)
- Exclude heavy artifacts from repo: agents/techwatch/reports/*/shots/, agents/funnels/out/*/shots/, node_modules/, build outputs.
- Keep **clean export** path for checkpoints; consider external storage (S3) for screenshots.

---

## Success Criteria (90 Days)
- Phase 1 trust surfaces shipped and visible; **CVR uplift ≥ 6%**.
- Phase 2 personalization + reviews live; **repeat rate +10–15%**.
- Phase 3 mall dashboards + POS integrations piloted; **pickup on-time ≥ 95%**.
- Public trust page (radical transparency) published.

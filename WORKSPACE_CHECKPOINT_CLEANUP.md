## Replit System Checkpoints
**Note:** I cannot manage Replit's system checkpoints directly. To clean up actual checkpoints:

1. **Use the Rollback Interface:**
   - Click the "View Checkpoints" button in your interface
   - Review checkpoint timestamps and descriptions
   - Delete older/duplicate checkpoints manually

2. **Checkpoint Management Best Practices:**
   - Keep only recent functional checkpoints
   - Remove checkpoints from failed builds
   - Keep major milestone checkpoints only

## Current Status
- **Workspace Size:** Reduced by removing duplicate documentation
- **Platform Status:** All SPIRAL functionality intact
- **Next Step:** Use Replit's checkpoint interface to remove system checkpoints

Your SPIRAL platform remains fully operational with all 18 AI agents working correctly.

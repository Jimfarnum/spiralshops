# Replit Storage Optimization for SPIRAL Platform

## Current Storage Analysis

### Your Replit Plan Status
- **Current Plan:** Core ($20/month)
- **Storage Limit:** 50GB
- **Current Usage:** 1.2GB (2.4% used - plenty of space available)
- **Disk Usage:** 38GB/50GB total system (76% - within normal range)

### The Real Issue: Project Complexity, Not Storage Limits
Your errors aren't from storage limits but from:
- **File Count:** 34,483+ files causing slow indexing
- **Project Complexity:** Large development artifacts affecting performance
- **Checkpoint Processing:** High file count slowing backup creation

- Backed by Google Cloud Storage
- Perfect for user uploads, images, documents
- Automatic scaling and high availability
- Pay-per-use pricing

**Best For:**
- User uploaded files (uploads/)
- Product images and assets
- Documentation and reports
- Competitive analysis screenshots

### Option 2: Upgrade to Teams Plan
**Cost:** $32/month per user
**Storage:** 256GB (5x more than current)
**Benefits:**
- Massive storage increase
- Better performance for large projects
- Team collaboration features
- Priority support

**Recommended If:** You need team collaboration or expect rapid growth

### Option 3: External Storage Integration
**Hybrid Approach:** Keep code in Replit, move assets to cloud
**Options:**
- AWS S3 + CloudFront CDN
- Google Cloud Storage
- Azure Blob Storage
- GitHub for code versioning

## Immediate Solution: Replit Object Storage Setup

### Step 1: Enable Object Storage
Replit's built-in object storage is perfect for your SPIRAL platform's needs:
- Handles all user uploads
- Serves product images efficiently
- Stores competitive analysis data
- Integrates seamlessly with your existing code

### Step 2: File Migration Strategy
**Move to Object Storage:**
```
uploads/                  # User uploaded files
attached_assets/          # Screenshots and documents  
agents/techwatch/reports/ # Competitive analysis outputs
security-reports/         # Audit documentation
docs/static/             # Static documentation assets
```

**Keep in Workspace:**
```
server/                  # Backend code
client/                  # Frontend code
mobile/                  # Mobile app source
shared/                  # Database schemas
scripts/                 # Deployment automation
package.json             # Dependencies
```

### Step 3: Performance Benefits
**Before:** 1.2GB workspace with 34,483+ files
**After:** ~300MB workspace with ~8,000 files
**Result:** 75% file count reduction, significantly faster performance

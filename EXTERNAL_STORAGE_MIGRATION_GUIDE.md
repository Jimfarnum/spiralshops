# SPIRAL External Storage Migration Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Reduce Replit Project Size by 60-70%

### Current Project Analysis
- **Total Size:** 1.2GB
- **Critical Code:** ~9MB (server, client, mobile, configs)
- **Documentation/Assets:** ~400MB (screenshots, reports, docs)
- **Build Artifacts:** ~500MB+ (node_modules, dist, cache)
- **Historical Data:** ~300MB (backups, logs, analysis outputs)

## ðŸ“Š Storage Breakdown & Migration Plan

### Immediate Wins (Move This Week)

**1. Large Asset Directories (~600MB)**
```bash
# These can be moved to external storage immediately:
attached_assets/          # 200MB+ - Screenshots, documents
security-reports/         # 50MB+ - Audit reports  
backups/                 # 100-500MB - Previous archives
docs/                    # 30MB+ - Documentation files
agents/techwatch/reports/ # 100MB+ - Competitive analysis screenshots
```

**Migration Target:** Google Drive, Dropbox, or AWS S3
**Benefit:** Immediate 50% project size reduction

**2. Build Artifacts (Auto-excluded)**
```bash
# Already excluded via .replitignore:
node_modules/            # 500MB+ - Dependencies (rebuild from package.json)
dist/                    # 50MB+ - Built frontend
build/                   # 20MB+ - Compiled outputs
.cache/                  # 30MB+ - Temporary cache
```

**Benefit:** Faster checkpoints, no data loss (rebuilds automatically)

### Phase 1: GitHub Repository Setup (Day 1)

**Purpose:** Professional version control and code backup
**Cost:** Free for public repos, $4/month for unlimited private

```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init
git add server/ client/ mobile/ shared/ scripts/ package.json *.md
git commit -m "SPIRAL Platform - Initial repository"

# Create GitHub repository and push
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/spiral-platform.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Benefits:**
- Complete code version history
- Collaboration capabilities
- Automated CI/CD pipeline potential
- Professional code management
- Free backup of essential files

### Phase 2: Cloud Storage for Assets (Week 1)

**Option A: Google Drive (Recommended for Small Teams)**
- **Cost:** Free (15GB), $6/month (100GB), $10/month (2TB)
- **Best For:** Documentation, screenshots, reports
- **Setup Time:** 15 minutes

```bash
# Manual upload process:
1. Create "SPIRAL Platform Assets" folder in Google Drive
2. Upload spiral-documentation-assets-*.tar.gz
3. Extract and organize by type:
   - Documentation/
   - Screenshots/
   - Security Reports/
   - Historical Data/
4. Share folder with team members
5. Update links in code to Google Drive URLs
```

**Option B: AWS S3 (Recommended for Production)**
- **Cost:** $0.023/GB/month (~$5/month for 200GB)
- **Best For:** Production assets, user uploads, scalable storage
- **Setup Time:** 30 minutes

```bash
# Automated upload process:
npm install -g aws-cli
aws configure  # Add your AWS credentials

# Create bucket
aws s3 mb s3://spiral-platform-assets

# Upload assets with organization
aws s3 sync attached_assets/ s3://spiral-platform-assets/documentation/
aws s3 sync security-reports/ s3://spiral-platform-assets/security/
aws s3 sync docs/ s3://spiral-platform-assets/docs/

# Make public for web access (if needed)
aws s3 cp s3://spiral-platform-assets/ s3://spiral-platform-assets/ --recursive --acl public-read
```

### Phase 3: Production Upload Migration (Week 2)

**Current User Uploads Location:** `uploads/`
**Migration Target:** Cloud storage with CDN

**AWS S3 + CloudFront Setup:**
```javascript
// Update server/routes.ts for S3 uploads
import AWS from 'aws-sdk';

const s3 = new AWS.S3({
  accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
  secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
  region: process.env.AWS_REGION
});

// Upload endpoint
app.post('/api/upload', upload.single('file'), async (req, res) => {
  const uploadParams = {
    Bucket: 'spiral-platform-uploads',
    Key: `uploads/${Date.now()}-${req.file.originalname}`,
    Body: req.file.buffer,
    ContentType: req.file.mimetype,
    ACL: 'public-read'
  };
  
  const result = await s3.upload(uploadParams).promise();
  res.json({ url: result.Location });
});
```

**Benefits:**
- Unlimited scalable storage
- Global CDN delivery
- Reduced server load
- Professional asset management

### Phase 4: Database and Cache Optimization (Week 3)

**Current Database:** PostgreSQL via Neon (appropriate, keep as-is)
**Optimization Target:** Cache and temporary data

**Redis Cache Setup (Optional):**
```bash
# For session storage and competitive analysis caching
# Add to package.json:
npm install redis

# Environment variable:
REDIS_URL=your_redis_connection_string
```

**Cloudant Migration (Historical Data):**
```bash
# Move large JSON datasets to IBM Cloudant
# Current fallback storage can be enhanced
# Best for: Competitive analysis historical data
```

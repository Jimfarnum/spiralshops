## Two-Domain Strategy Explanation

### **spiralmalls.com (Primary - Keep As-Is):**
- Main working domain with valid SSL
- All traffic ultimately goes here
- This is your production domain

### **spiralshops.com (Secondary - Fix with Redirect):**
- Update DNS to point to Replit server
- Server redirects to spiralmalls.com
- Fixes SSL certificate error

## What Happens After spiralshops.com DNS Fix

### **User Flow:**
1. User visits spiralshops.com
2. DNS points to your Replit server (new CNAME)
3. Replit server redirects to spiralmalls.com
4. User reaches working site with valid SSL
5. No certificate warnings anywhere

### **Benefits:**
- Both domains work seamlessly
- Users can find you via either domain
- SEO benefits from both domains
- Single SSL certificate to manage

## Verification Commands

```bash

```

## Summary

**Action Required:**
- ‚úÖ spiralmalls.com: Keep existing DNS settings (working correctly)
- üîß spiralshops.com: Update DNS with CNAME to Replit server

**Result:**
- Both domains will work
- SSL certificate issue resolved
- Users get seamless access via either domain

The strategy is to fix the broken domain (spiralshops.com) by redirecting it to the working domain (spiralmalls.com), not to change both domains.

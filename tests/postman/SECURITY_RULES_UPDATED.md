# SPIRAL Security Rules Configuration - Updated

**Date**: August 14, 2025  
**Update**: ZAP timestamp disclosure noise reduction implemented

## Updated Security Rules

### ZAP Configuration Enhancement
**File**: `.zap/rules.tsv`

**New Rule Added**:
```tsv
# Timestamp Disclosure: lower noise  
10096   WARN    INFO
```

### Complete Security Rules Coverage

#### High Severity (FAIL on detection)
- **SQL Injection (40018)**: Critical database security
- **Cross Site Scripting (40012)**: XSS prevention

#### Medium Severity (WARN on detection)
- **Content Security Policy (10038)**: CSP header validation
- **X-Frame-Options (10020)**: Clickjacking protection
- **X-Content-Type-Options (10021)**: MIME type sniffing prevention
- **Strict-Transport-Security (10035)**: HTTPS enforcement
- **Weak Authentication (10105)**: Authentication method validation
- **Session ID in URL (3)**: Session security
- **Timestamp Disclosure (10096)**: Information leakage (noise reduced)

#### Low Severity (INFO logging)
- **Directory Browsing (0)**: Directory exposure detection
- **Server Information Leakage (10037)**: X-Powered-By headers
- **Cookie Security (10010, 10011)**: HttpOnly and Secure flags
- **Cache Control (10015)**: HTTP caching headers

## Security Configuration Status

### Rule Effectiveness
- **Critical Vulnerabilities**: Immediate failure on detection
- **Security Headers**: Warning level for compliance monitoring
- **Information Disclosure**: Informational logging with reduced noise
- **Authentication**: Medium severity for access control validation

### Platform Integration
The updated rules provide:
1. **Focused Alerting**: Reduced false positives from timestamp disclosure
2. **Critical Protection**: Maintained high-severity blocking for SQL injection and XSS
3. **Professional Reporting**: Balanced noise-to-signal ratio for security teams
4. **Compliance Monitoring**: Comprehensive HTTP security header validation

### Testing Impact
With the noise reduction for timestamp disclosure (Rule 10096):
- **Cleaner Reports**: Fewer low-impact warnings in security scans
- **Focus on Critical**: Enhanced visibility for high-impact vulnerabilities
- **Professional Output**: More actionable security assessment reports

## Integration with SPIRAL Platform

### Current Platform Status
- All core systems operational
- SOAP G Central Brain: 7 AI agents running
- Security infrastructure: Ready for automated scanning
- API performance: Maintained under security testing

### Security Scanning Ready
The updated configuration enables:
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated security pipeline with refined rules
- **Local Testing**: Professional-grade security validation
- **Production Monitoring**: Continuous security assessment
- **Compliance Validation**: OWASP baseline compliance

## Usage in Security Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Integration
```yaml
# ZAP Baseline Scan with updated rules
- name: ZAP Baseline Scan
  uses: zaproxy/action-baseline@v0.12.0
  with:
    target: "https://spiralshops.com"
    rules_file_name: ".zap/rules.tsv"  # Uses updated rules
    cmd_options: "-a"
```

### Local Security Testing
```bash
# Run with updated rules
zap-baseline.py -t http://localhost:5000 -c .zap/rules.tsv -r zap-report.html
```

**Status**: Security rules optimized for professional scanning with reduced noise and maintained critical protection coverage.

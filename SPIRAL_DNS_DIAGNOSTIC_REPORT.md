# SPIRAL DNS Diagnostic Report

## Issue Identified: spiralshops.com DNS Resolution Failure

### Problem Description
- **spiralshops.com**: DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN error in browser
- **spiralmalls.com**: Working perfectly with SSL certificate

### DNS Analysis

#### Google DNS Resolution (8.8.8.8):
- **spiralmalls.com**: ✅ Resolves to `34.111.179.208`
- **spiralshops.com**: ✅ Resolves to `34.111.179.208` (conflicting with browser error)

### Root Cause Analysis
The DNS records appear correct in authoritative servers, but there's likely:
1. **DNS Propagation Delay**: Some DNS resolvers haven't updated
2. **TTL Caching**: Old records cached in various DNS resolvers
3. **ISP DNS Issues**: User's mobile carrier DNS may have stale records

### Immediate Solution Strategy

#### Option 1: DNS Cache Flush (User Action Required)
User needs to:
- Clear Chrome DNS cache: chrome://net-internals/#dns
- Restart Chrome browser
- Try different network (WiFi vs mobile data)

#### Option 2: Temporary Redirect Solution (Platform Fix)
Configure spiralshops.com to redirect to spiralmalls.com at the DNS level

#### Option 3: DNS Provider Reset
Re-configure DNS records with shorter TTL for faster propagation

### Platform Status
- **Primary Domain (spiralmalls.com)**: ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL
- **Secondary Domain (spiralshops.com)**: ⚠️ DNS PROPAGATION ISSUE

### Recommendation

## **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**

### Week 1-2: Architecture & Database Design
```sql
-- New database tables needed
CREATE TABLE retailer_analytics (
  retailer_id VARCHAR(255),
  metric_type VARCHAR(100),
  metric_value DECIMAL(12,2),
  time_period TIMESTAMP,
  local_context JSON
);

CREATE TABLE spiral_centers (
  center_id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
  location POINT,
  capacity_cubic_feet INTEGER,
  operating_hours JSON,
  connected_retailers TEXT[]
);

CREATE TABLE inventory_network (
  network_id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
  retailer_id VARCHAR(255),
  product_id VARCHAR(255),
  shareable_quantity INTEGER,
  transfer_rules JSON
);
```

### Week 3-4: Backend API Development
```typescript
// New API endpoints to create
app.post('/api/analytics/retailer-dashboard', getRetailerAnalytics);
app.get('/api/fulfillment/spiral-centers', getSpiralCenters);
app.post('/api/inventory/network-check', checkNetworkInventory);
app.post('/api/logistics/optimize-delivery', optimizeDeliveryRoutes);
```

## **COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES GAINED**

# üîß spiralmalls.com DNS Configuration Fix

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ **spiralshops.com** - Verified and working
- ‚ùå **spiralmalls.com** - DNS not configured, domain verification failed

## Quick Fix Steps for spiralmalls.com

### Step 1: Add Domain in Replit Deployment
1. **Go to your Replit Deployments tab**
2. **Click on your deployment** (the one with spiralshops.com working)
3. **Go to Settings ‚Üí Domains**
4. **Click "Link domain"**
5. **Enter:** `spiralmalls.com`
6. **Copy the DNS records** that Replit provides

### Step 2: Expected DNS Records Format
When you add spiralmalls.com in Replit, you'll get records like:

**A Record:**
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: [Replit IP address - likely same as spiralshops.com]
TTL: Auto
```

**TXT Record for Verification:**
```
Type: TXT
Name: @
Value: replit-verify=[unique verification code]
TTL: Auto
```

### Step 3: Configure in GoDaddy DNS
1. **Login to GoDaddy** ‚Üí My Products ‚Üí DNS
2. **Find spiralmalls.com** ‚Üí Manage
3. **Delete any existing A records** for spiralmalls.com
4. **Add the new A record** (from Replit)
5. **Add the new TXT record** (from Replit)

### Step 4: Verification
1. **Save changes in GoDaddy**
2. **Wait 15-30 minutes**
3. **Return to Replit** ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Domains
4. **Click "Verify domain"** next to spiralmalls.com
5. **Should show "Verified" status**

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Multiple A Records
- **Problem:** Old A records interfere
- **Fix:** Delete ALL existing A records before adding new one

### Issue 2: Wrong @ Symbol
- **Problem:** GoDaddy name field incorrect
- **Fix:** Use exactly `@` (not blank, not domain name)

### Issue 3: DNS Propagation
- **Problem:** Changes not live yet
- **Timeline:** 15 minutes to 2 hours typically
- **Test:** `nslookup spiralmalls.com` should show Replit IP

## After DNS Fix is Complete

Both domains will work:
- **spiralshops.com** ‚Üí Main platform (already working)
- **spiralmalls.com** ‚Üí Same platform (will work after DNS fix)

## Optional: Domain Redirect Setup
If you want spiralmalls.com to redirect to spiralshops.com:

Add to your `vercel.json` or deployment config:
```json
{
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "https://spiralmalls.com/:path*",
      "destination": "https://spiralshops.com/:path*",
      "permanent": true
    }
  ]
}
```

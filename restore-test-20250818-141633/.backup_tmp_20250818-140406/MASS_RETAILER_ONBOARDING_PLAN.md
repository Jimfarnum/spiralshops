    digital_presence * 0.20 +        # Website, social media activity
    location_priority * 0.20 +       # High-traffic areas, mall presence  
    category_fit * 0.15 +            # SPIRAL target categories
    growth_indicators * 0.10 +       # Recent expansion, hiring
    competition_gap * 0.10           # Low local competition
)

# Automated targeting criteria
target_criteria = {
    "business_size": "10-500 employees",

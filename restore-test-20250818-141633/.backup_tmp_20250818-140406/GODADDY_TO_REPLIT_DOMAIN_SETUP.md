# üåê Redirect spiralmalls.com from GoDaddy to Replit

**Goal:** Point your spiralmalls.com domain from GoDaddy to your SPIRAL platform on Replit

## Step 1: Deploy Your SPIRAL App on Replit

1. **Click the "Deploy" button** in your Replit workspace
2. **Choose your deployment settings:**
   - App Name: `spiral-platform` (or your preferred name)
   - Region: Choose closest to your target audience
   - Plan: Select appropriate plan based on traffic needs

3. **Wait for deployment to complete** - Replit will provide you with:
   - Deployment URL (e.g., `spiral-platform-username.replit.app`)
   - DNS records for custom domain setup

## Step 2: Get DNS Records from Replit

After successful deployment:

1. **Go to Deployments tab** in your Replit workspace
2. **Click on Settings tab**
3. **Select "Link a domain"** or **"Manually connect from another registrar"**
4. **Enter your domain:** `spiralmalls.com`
5. **Copy the generated DNS records** - Replit will provide:
   - **A Record:** Points to Replit's IP address
   - **TXT Record:** For domain verification
   - **CNAME Record:** (if using subdomain)

## Step 3: Configure DNS in GoDaddy

### Login to GoDaddy Account
1. Go to [GoDaddy.com](https://godaddy.com)
2. Sign in to your account
3. Navigate to **"My Products"** ‚Üí **"DNS"**
4. Click **"Manage"** next to spiralmalls.com

### Add DNS Records

#### For Main Domain (spiralmalls.com):

**Add A Record:**
- **Type:** A
- **Host:** @ (or spiralmalls.com if @ not supported)
- **Points to:** [IP address provided by Replit]
- **TTL:** 1 Hour

**Add TXT Record:**
- **Type:** TXT
- **Host:** @ (or spiralmalls.com)
- **Value:** [TXT value provided by Replit]
- **TTL:** 1 Hour

#### For WWW Subdomain (www.spiralmalls.com):

**Add CNAME Record:**
- **Type:** CNAME
- **Host:** www
- **Points to:** [Your Replit deployment URL]
- **TTL:** 1 Hour

### Remove Conflicting Records
- **Delete any existing A records** that point to old hosting
- **Delete any CNAME records** that conflict with your new setup
- **Keep MX records** (for email) if you use GoDaddy email

## Step 4: Verify Domain Connection

### In Replit:
1. Return to your Replit deployment settings
2. Click **"Verify Domain"** after adding DNS records
3. Wait for verification (may take a few minutes)

### Test Your Domain:
- Visit `spiralmalls.com` in browser
- Visit `www.spiralmalls.com` in browser
- Both should show your SPIRAL platform

## Step 5: Enable HTTPS (Automatic)

Replit automatically provides SSL/HTTPS for custom domains:
- Certificate generation is automatic
- Your site will be accessible via `https://spiralmalls.com`
- HTTP traffic automatically redirects to HTTPS

## ‚è∞ DNS Propagation Timeline

- **Initial propagation:** 15 minutes - 2 hours
- **Full global propagation:** Up to 48 hours
- **Most users see changes:** Within 4-6 hours

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If Domain Doesn't Work:

1. **Check DNS propagation:**
   - Use [whatsmydns.net](https://www.whatsmydns.net)
   - Enter spiralmalls.com and check A record

2. **Verify DNS records in GoDaddy:**
   - Ensure A record points to correct Replit IP
   - Ensure TXT record matches Replit's verification code

3. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
   - Try incognito/private browsing

4. **Check Replit deployment status:**
   - Ensure deployment is active and running
   - Check deployment logs for any issues

### Common Issues:

- **"DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN"** = DNS records not propagated yet
- **"This site can't be reached"** = A record pointing to wrong IP
- **Security warnings** = Wait for SSL certificate generation
